# Quality, Quantity, and Claims Management in Physical Commodity Trading

This document explains how **quality and quantity determination** works in physical commodity trading and how **claims arise, are managed, and are resolved**.

Quality and quantity disputes are not edge cases. They are a **structural feature** of physical markets and one of the most common sources of post-delivery PnL leakage.

## 1. Why Quality and Quantity Matter Economically

In physical trading, price is rarely paid on a theoretical specification.  
It is paid on **measured outcomes**.

Small deviations in:
- Quality
- Quantity
- Measurement method
- Timing of determination  

can materially change:
- Final invoice value
- Hedge effectiveness
- Working capital
- Relationship with counterparties

Claims are the mechanism through which these differences are reconciled.

---

## 2. Quality Determination: What Is Being Measured

### What “Quality” Means in Practice

Quality refers to **measurable physical characteristics** of the commodity, such as:
- Chemical composition (e.g. sulfur, ash, moisture)
- Physical properties (e.g. density, viscosity, size)
- Performance-related attributes (e.g. calorific value)

Quality is not an opinion. It is a **measurement outcome tied to a method**.

---

### Quality Specifications in Contracts

A contract typically defines:
- Reference specification
- Acceptable tolerance or range
- Method of sampling and analysis
- Consequences of deviation (penalty, rejection, or claim)

Ambiguity in any of these areas creates **latent claim risk**.

---

## 3. Sampling and Inspection

### Why Sampling Is Critical

Sampling determines **what gets measured**.  
Analysis only applies to the sample provided.

Common sampling points:
- At load port
- At discharge port
- Composite samples across the shipment

---

### Independent Inspectors

Independent inspection companies are typically appointed to:
- Supervise sampling
- Conduct laboratory analysis
- Issue certificates used for invoicing and claims

Their reports often become the **primary evidence** in disputes.

---

### Key Reality

Most quality disputes are **sampling disputes**, not laboratory disputes.

---

## 4. Quantity Determination: How Volume and Weight Are Measured

### Common Quantity Measurement Methods

- Draft survey (bulk cargoes)
- Tank gauging (liquids)
- Weighbridge measurement
- Flow meters

Each method has:
- A margin of error
- Known biases
- Operational sensitivities

---

### Contractual Quantity Definitions

Contracts usually specify:
- Quantity reference point (load vs discharge)
- Allowable tolerance
- Shrinkage or loss allowance
- Governing measurement method

Failure to align commercial assumptions with these definitions is a frequent cause of claims.

---

## 5. Load vs Discharge: Where Disputes Arise

### Load Port Determination
- Reflects shipped quantity and quality
- Often used for pricing and provisional invoicing

### Discharge Port Determination
- Reflects received quantity and quality
- Used to assess losses, contamination, or degradation

Differences between load and discharge are expected. The dispute is about **who bears them**.

---

## 6. Typical Claim Types

### Quantity Claims
- Shortage between load and discharge
- Loss beyond contractual tolerance
- Measurement error disputes

### Quality Claims
- Off-spec parameters
- Penalty-triggering deviations
- Blending or contamination issues

### Operational Claims
- Demurrage and despatch
- Delay-related deterioration
- Handling damage

---

## 7. Claims Timeline and Process

Claims are governed by **strict contractual timelines**.

  C --> D[Evidence Submission]
  D --> E[Negotiation]
  E --> F[Settlement or Arbitration]
```

## Key Steps

- Identify deviation  
- Notify counterparty within the contractual **time bar**  
- Compile supporting evidence  
- Negotiate commercially  
- Escalate if unresolved  

Missing a deadline can **invalidate an otherwise valid claim**.

---

## 8. Evidence: What Actually Matters

Successful claims are built on **documentation, not arguments**.

Typical evidence includes:
- Inspection certificates  
- Statements of Facts  
- Bills of Lading  
- Surveyor reports  
- Photographs and operational logs  
- Correspondence timeline  

The **burden of proof** often sits with the claimant.

---

## 9. Interaction with Pricing and Hedging

Quality and quantity outcomes affect:
- Final price adjustments  
- Delivered cost  
- Hedge reconciliation  

### Example
- A quality penalty reduces the invoice value  
- The hedge is closed at the expected flat price  
- The resulting PnL shortfall appears “unexplained” unless attributed correctly  

Claims should be **included in PnL attribution**, not treated as exceptions.

---

## 10. Common Failure Modes

- Vague quality specifications  
- Sampling method not clearly defined  
- Late claim notification  
- Over-reliance on counterparties’ inspectors  
- Treating claims as back-office issues  

Most claim losses originate **before the trade is executed**, not after.

---

## 11. Best Practices for Trading Desks

### Before Trading
- Specify sampling and analysis methods clearly  
- Understand measurement error ranges  
- Price in expected losses and penalties  

### During Execution
- Monitor the inspection process actively  
- Maintain independent records  
- Coordinate operations, trading, and risk teams  

### After Delivery
- Review inspection results immediately  
- Track claim deadlines rigorously  
- Attribute claim outcomes to trade economics

## Summary

Quality and quantity are not administrative details. They are **core economic variables** in physical commodity trading.

Claims management is not about conflict. It is about ensuring that **commercial intent survives physical reality**.
