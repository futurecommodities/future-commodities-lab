# Risk Controls in Physical Commodity Trading

This document outlines the **core risk control framework** used in physical commodity trading.  
Risk controls are not designed to eliminate risk. They exist to **prevent small, manageable risks from compounding into desk-threatening losses**.

Strong risk controls enable traders to take risk deliberately rather than accidentally.

## 1. Why Risk Controls Matter in Physical Trading

Physical commodity trading combines:
- Market risk  
- Credit risk  
- Operational risk  
- Liquidity risk  
- Legal and compliance risk  

These risks **interact**, often non-linearly. A failure in one area can amplify losses in another.

Risk controls exist to:
- Define risk boundaries  
- Enforce discipline under pressure  
- Protect capital and reputation  
- Enable sustainable risk-taking

## 2. Credit Risk Controls

### Counterparty Approval
Before trading, counterparties should be:
- KYC-verified
- Sanctions-screened
- Approved by credit or compliance teams

### Credit Limits
Credit limits typically cover:
- Outstanding invoices
- Open exposure on unpriced trades
- Mark-to-market exposure on hedges

Trading beyond approved limits is one of the **fastest paths to catastrophic loss**.

### Risk Signals
- Repeated payment delays
- Requests for looser terms
- Resistance to documentation

These signals should trigger **immediate review**, not accommodation.

---

## 3. Market Risk Controls

### Position Limits
Limits may be defined by:
- Volume
- Notional value
- Tenor
- Product or location

Position limits prevent **concentration risk**, especially during volatile markets.

### Pricing Authority
Controls define:
- Who can price trades
- What references may be used
- Acceptable pricing windows and formulas

Uncontrolled pricing discretion creates hidden optionality.

---

## 4. Operational Risk Controls

Operational risk is often underestimated because losses appear small individually but **compound over time**.

Key controls include:
- Segregation of duties (trading vs operations vs settlement)
- Standardized procedures and checklists
- Independent verification of key steps

### Common Operational Failures
- Incorrect shipping instructions
- Missed nominations or deadlines
- Incomplete documentation
- Miscommunication between teams

Most operational losses are **preventable with process discipline**.

---

## 5. Legal and Contractual Controls

### Contract Review
Contracts should be reviewed for:
- Consistency with commercial intent
- Clear risk and title transfer points
- Defined dispute resolution mechanisms

### Clause Discipline
Special attention should be paid to:
- Quality and quantity clauses
- Time bars for claims
- Force majeure definitions
- Governing law and arbitration

Ambiguous contracts shift risk from markets to lawyers.

## 6. Liquidity and Cash Flow Controls

Physical trading consumes liquidity through:
- Inventory financing
- Margin calls on hedges
- Freight and logistics prepayments

Controls include:
- Cash flow forecasting under stress scenarios
- Margin liquidity buffers
- Coordination between trading and treasury

A trade can be profitable and still fail due to **liquidity stress**.

---

## 7. Hedging and Basis Risk Controls

Risk controls around hedging should address:
- Hedge alignment with physical exposure
- Volume and timing mismatches
- Basis volatility

Controls include:
- Defined hedge ratios
- Regular exposure reconciliation
- Escalation triggers for basis widening

Unmonitored hedges create a **false sense of safety**.

---

## 8. Limit Breaches and Escalation

Risk frameworks must define:
- What constitutes a breach
- Who must be notified
- Required corrective actions

Escalation is not a failure.  
Failure is **not escalating when limits are breached**.

---

## 9. Governance and Oversight

Effective governance includes:
- Independent risk oversight
- Regular reporting to management
- Post-trade reviews and audits

Governance should focus on **process quality**, not just outcomes.

---

## 10. Culture as a Risk Control

The strongest risk control is cultural:
- Encouraging transparency
- Rewarding discipline
- Avoiding blame-driven responses

A culture that punishes bad outcomes rather than bad processes will eventually hide risk.

---

## Summary

Risk controls are not constraints on trading skill.  
They are the **infrastructure that makes skill sustainable**.

In physical commodity trading, survival depends less on predicting prices and more on **controlling how risk accumulates across people, processes, and markets**.
