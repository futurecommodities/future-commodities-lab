# Incoterms and Payment Terms in Physical Commodity Trading

This document explains how **Incoterms** and **payment terms** shape risk, cash flow, and operational responsibility in physical commodity trading.  
It focuses on **commercial reality**, not legal definitions.

Understanding the interaction between Incoterms and payment terms is critical. Most losses in physical trading occur not because the price was wrong, but because **risk and cash flow were misunderstood**.

## 1. What Incoterms Actually Do (and Do Not Do)

### What Incoterms Define
Incoterms define:
- Where **delivery** occurs
- When **risk transfers** from seller to buyer
- Who pays for which **logistics costs**
- Who is responsible for **export/import formalities**

### What Incoterms Do NOT Define
Incoterms do **not** define:
- When **title** transfers (unless explicitly stated in the contract)
- Payment terms
- Quality specifications
- Consequences of breach
- Governing law or arbitration

**Key principle:**  
Incoterms allocate *logistics risk*, not *commercial intent*.

---

## 2. Common Incoterms Used in Commodity Trading

### EXW – Ex Works
- Seller makes goods available at their premises
- Buyer assumes almost all responsibility and risk

**Used when:**
- Buyer has strong local logistics capability
- Often avoided in bulk commodities due to complexity

**Key risk:**  
Seller retains minimal responsibility; buyer bears early operational risk.

---

### FOB – Free On Board
- Delivery occurs when goods are loaded onto the vessel
- Risk transfers at the ship’s rail (or equivalent loading point)

**Common in:**
- Bulk commodities (oil, coal, grain, metals)
- International seaborne trade

**Commercial meaning:**  
Seller controls upstream logistics, buyer controls freight and downstream risk.

---

### CFR / CIF – Cost and Freight / Cost, Insurance and Freight
- Seller arranges and pays freight
- Risk still transfers at loading, not at destination
- CIF additionally requires seller to provide insurance

**Common in:**
- International bulk trades where buyer wants delivered economics

**Key misunderstanding:**  
Paying for freight does **not** mean bearing freight risk.

---

### DAP / DDP – Delivered at Place / Delivered Duty Paid
- Seller bears most logistics responsibility
- Delivery occurs at destination

**Used when:**
- Seller has downstream logistics capability
- Often seen in refined products or packaged commodities

**Key risk:**  
Seller absorbs delays, customs issues, and destination congestion risk.

---

## 3. Incoterms and Risk Transfer (Why This Matters)

Risk transfer determines:
- Who bears loss from delays, damage, or force majeure
- When insurance should respond
- How demurrage and storage costs are allocated

**Common pitfall:**  
Operational teams assume risk transfers at destination, while contracts say risk transfers at loading.

Always reconcile:
- Incoterm
- Risk clause
- Title clause
- Insurance coverage

---

## 4. Payment Terms: How Cash Actually Moves

Payment terms define:
- When cash is paid
- What documents are required
- Which party bears financing risk

They often matter **more than price** for capital-intensive desks.

---

## 5. Common Payment Methods

### Letter of Credit (LC)

**How it works**
- Buyer’s bank commits to pay upon compliant document presentation
- Payment is document-driven, not performance-driven

**Advantages**
- Reduces counterparty credit risk
- Enables trade finance

**Risks**
- Documentary discrepancies
- Delayed payment despite physical delivery

**Used when**
- New counterparties
- Emerging markets
- Large ticket sizes

---

### Documentary Collection (DP / DA)

**DP – Documents Against Payment**
- Buyer pays before receiving documents

**DA – Documents Against Acceptance**
- Buyer accepts a bill of exchange and pays later

**Risks**
- Bank provides no payment guarantee
- Relies on buyer’s willingness and ability to pay

---

### Open Account

**How it works**
- Goods delivered first
- Payment occurs later (e.g., 30–90 days)

**Advantages**
- Commercially attractive
- Simple documentation

**Risks**
- Full exposure to buyer credit risk

**Used when**
- Long-term relationships
- Strong creditworthiness

---

### Prepayment

**How it works**
- Buyer pays before shipment

**Risks**
- Buyer bears seller performance risk

**Used when**
- Tight markets
- Supply-constrained products

---

## 6. Matching Incoterms with Payment Terms

Some combinations are structurally safer than others.

### Typical Pairings
- FOB + LC
- CIF + LC
- FOB + Open Account (with strong credit)
- DDP + Prepayment (seller-dominant markets)

### Structurally Risky Pairings
- DDP + Open Account (seller bears logistics and credit risk)
- CIF + DA (seller bears freight cost with weak payment assurance)

**Rule of thumb:**  
The more logistics risk you take, the stronger your payment protection should be.

---

## 7. Cash Flow Timing and Working Capital

Payment terms directly affect:
- Inventory financing
- Margin calls on hedges
- Credit line usage

**Example**
- FOB + LC at sight: limited working capital strain
- CIF + 60-day open account: seller finances freight + cargo + hedge margin

This interaction is often underestimated in PnL planning.

---

## 8. Operational Controls and Best Practices

### Before Contracting
- Align Incoterm with actual logistics capability
- Confirm payment method feasibility with banks
- Stress-test cash flow under delays

### During Execution
- Monitor document preparation closely
- Track risk transfer point vs hedge exposure
- Coordinate ops, finance, and trading desks

### After Delivery
- Reconcile payment timing vs hedge close-out
- Review discrepancies and delays

---

## 9. Common Failure Modes

- Assuming insurance equals risk transfer
- Ignoring cash flow impact of pricing delays
- Misaligned Incoterms and demurrage clauses
- Treating payment terms as boilerplate

Most operational losses are **structural**, not accidental.

---

## Summary

Incoterms define **who carries logistics risk**.  
Payment terms define **who carries credit and financing risk**.

Successful physical trading requires aligning both with:
- Counterparty strength
- Logistics capability
- Balance sheet capacity

Price alone is never the full trade.
